# ZKP-integration-with-AI
Training AI models securely has been a huge problem, faces challenges like handling large volumes of sensitive data and implementing strong security measures like encryption, access control, and compliance with regulations. Adversarial attacks, where malicious input can manipulate AI systems, are also a significant concern. These factors make ensuring the privacy and security of AI training data complex and crucial.

During the lockdown I started learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI),  later on I learned about Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns and making decisions. 

ZKPs are cryptographic protocols that enable one party (the prover) to prove to another (the verifier) that they possess certain knowledge without revealing the actual knowledge itself. This concept allows for authentication and verification without disclosing sensitive information. 

I started my project in February 2024. My Project involves developing a method to implement ZKPs into AI to ensure a secure way of training sensitive data. The goal is to develop an algorithm to encrypt the data utilising zero-knowledge protocol, which will allow AI models access to the data without disclosure of the raw data. 

Implementing ZKPs into AI in real world scenarios involve extremely advanced encryption and mathematical procedures. For my project, Iâ€™ve decided to train a simple Linear Regression model based on the data encrypted with a basic ZKP.  This will be able to demonstrate a secure training on data, at a basic level.
